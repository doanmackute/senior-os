# SeniorOS - Operating system for late elderly and cognitive challenged users

The system is **under development** and the code is to be used only by the **students** at Brno University of Technology

- The idea is to develop an operating system suitable for individuals aged 90+ and those with cognitive challenges
- These users encounter difficulties when using common desktop systems and require assistance from their caregivers
- Late elderly and cognitive challenged users are easy targets for cyber criminals
 
The operating system is built on top of a Linux distribution; it contains an email client, web browser, and caregiver application 

Developed by students via their bachelor’s and master’s theses; supervised by [Dan Komosny](https://www.vut.cz/en/people/dan-komosny-3065)
